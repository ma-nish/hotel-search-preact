# Virgin Atlantic ~ Hotel Search Results (Front-end)
## Rules
You must write the application in React or Preact (as this is our technology of choice).

In addition you should adhere to the following conditions:

1) It must be easy to run using libraries & tools commonly available on a development machine. 
1) Clear instructions for how to build and run the application should be included within the code, e.g. `README.md`
1) The code must be your own work. If you have a strong case to use a small code snippet of someone else's e.g. a
boilerplate function, it must be clearly commented and attributed to the original author.
1) You must include any unit tests you think are appropriate.
1) Give consideration to performance.

## What it should do
Build a 'search results page' which connects to our holiday search API to display a list of holidays for a given location and departure date.  Select what data items (example listed below) you think should be included on the page.

Available locations include: 'new-york', 'orlando', 'barbados', 'toronto'.

Add the ability to filter the results further by:

1) Price per person
1) Hotel facilities 
1) Star rating

The interface should be a web-based React application.

You can call our API service by making a POST request as follows (please note that the departure date must be some date in the future!):

```

}
```
